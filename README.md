# Euclidean Distance Calculator

This Python program calculates the Euclidean distance between pairs of points in a 2D space and finds the minimum distance between any two points.

## How It Works

1. **Points List**: A list of 2D points is created as tuples, like `(x, y)`.
2. **Distance Function**: The `euclideanDistance` function calculates the distance between two points.
3. **Loop**: The program loops through all point pairs and calculates distances.
4. **Find Minimum**: The minimum distance from the list of calculated distances is printed.

## Running the Program

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yigitbstnci/EuclideanDistance.git
   cd euclidean-distance-calculator

 2.Run the script:
 ```bash
  python euclidean_distance_calculator.py
